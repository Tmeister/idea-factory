# Description
Idea Factory was born out of necessity, and the frustration of the lack of plugins that did exactly what I wanted it to do. This plugin allows users to submit new ideas from the front-end, and vote on them. Currently it allows a user to vote once per idea, then locks them out. It's also currently limited to logged in users, for now.
