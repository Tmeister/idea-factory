Front end submission and voting system.

== Description ==

Idea Factory was born out of necessity, and the frustration of the lack of plugins that did exactly what I wanted it to do. This plugin allows users to submit new ideas from the front-end, and vote on them. Currently, it allows a user to vote once per idea, then locks them out.

* AJAX powered front-end submission and voting
* Works for both logged in and logged out users
* 1 vote allowed per user per idea
* Emails the admin of a new submission
* Automatic setup or use anywhere with a shortcode
* Optionally set a threshold where each idea will be given a status based on total votes and emails the admin
* Automatic status grading
* Extensible with hooks and actions on events
* More ideas loaded with AJAX on front-end
* Mobile friendly

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I override the layout? =
Yep. Copy the file from idea-factory/templates/template-ideas into your theme and it will use your file instead. Note, you'll need to keep track of updates to the source file and update accordingly. Check out using hooks, actions, or filters for adding, or changing things.
